# Survey Redirect
## How to use
Open ```last.json``` and enter your own urls as values for ```A``` and ```B```.

## Explanation
The code in ```index.php``` reads ```last.json``` and updates the ```last``` value to either ```A``` or ```B```.
Then it redirects to the url entered for ```A``` or ```B``` in an alternating fashion.
